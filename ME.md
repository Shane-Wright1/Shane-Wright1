- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shane-Wright1
- 👀 I’m interested in Development, and learning how to create code which will be useful
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ using multiple tools like Codecademy and learncpp
- 💞️ I’m looking to observe for now until I am confident enough in my abilities that I feel I can be helpful to others
