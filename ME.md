- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Shane-Wright1
- Iâ€™m interested in Development, and learning how to create code which will be useful.
- I'm enrolled in a course on Software Development at University level.
- Iâ€™m currently learning C# using multiple tools like Codecademy, and SoloLearn.
- Iâ€™m looking to observe for now until I am confident enough in my abilities that I feel I can be helpful to others.
